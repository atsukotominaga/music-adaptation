## WHEN PARTICIPANT ARRIVES:

- *Italic*: Verbal instruction
- >: **What to do**
- Please use a checklist to make sure you don't forget each procedure.

### Introduction
*Thank you for participating in the experiment. The aim of the experiment is to investigate how people play a piece of music expressively. The experiment is going to last about one hour.*

*If you have any questions or concerns, please ask the experimenter at any time about the nature of the study or the methods we are using. Also, you have the right to withdraw from the experiment at any time.*

*Before we start the experiment, please read the information sheet carefully and fill it out if you agree to take part in the study.*

> **Collect the informed consent form**

### Warm-up session
*Now, you are going to play what you practised during the experiment. Before we start testing, I would like you to practise your favourite pieces / exercises so that you can get used to the digital piano. I am going to leave the room, so when you think that you can comfortably perform music with this piano, please let me know.*

> **Experimenter should leave the room / Let participants practise their favourite pieces alone**

### Pre-check session
> **Open check.maxpat**

TBC

### Experiment

Read instructions on `Slides 1-5`.
Playing phase: performances are only recorded after the metronome beats!

Definition (based on Wikipedia)

- Legato: musical notes are played smoothly and connected
- Staccato: musical notes have shortened duration and are separated from each other
- Forte: louder sound
- Piano: quieter sound

> **Open experiment.maxpat**

> **1 - 16 trials**

> **Close experiment.maxpat**

### Post-check session
> **Open check.maxpat**

TBC

## Questionnaire

*Thank you. This is the end of the experiment. Lastly, could you please fill in the questionnaire?*

> **Collect the short questionnaire**

*Thank you for coming today and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about our study.*

## AFTER PARTICIPANT LEAVES:
1. Check whether data were recorded correctly. If not, leave a memo on the checklist.
2. Quit Max.
3. Turn off the piano, the audio interface and the screen in front of the piano.

## Notes
- If participants ask whether they can use different fingerings, please let them know that they can play as they like.
- If participants ask whether they should keep the tempo or not, please let them know that they can play as they like, but keep in mind the metronome tells you the original tempo of this piece.
- If participants ask anything related to detailed information about each skill (e.g., deeper legato? normal/subito forte?), just ask them to play as they like.
- If participants start playing before the metronome beats, please record the same trial again.
