## sheetmusic
Sheet music for 4 types of expressions
1. without expression (stim_n)
2. with articulation (stim_a)
3. with dynamics (stim_d)
4. with articulation and dynamics (stim_m)

## expstimuli
See details in [Memo](https://github.com/atsukotominaga/adaptation-v1.0/tree/master/material/stimuli/)

## prerating
3 raters including myself rated how much each expression (e.g., articulation and dynamics) was implemented in each performance.

### psychopy3
- `rating.py`: for the experiment
- `midiplayer.maxpat`: to make midi sound from `rating.py`

### others
- `image`: experimental stimuli (sheet music)
- `mid`: experimental stimuli (performance data)
- `practice`: stimuli for practice trials

## etc
- `cropped`: cropped sheet music
